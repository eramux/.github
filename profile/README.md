## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### We're Hotellistat,

and we are creating the next generation of hotel RMB* software.

<sub><sup>* RMB: Revenue-management, Market-analysis and Business-intelligence</sup></sub>

### Contribution

We accept contributions to our OSS projects. 

Please follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Navigate to the project
2. Create a new issue, stating what you would like to contribute and what it solves
3. We'll discuss your issue and will accept or reject it
4. You, others or we can then create a PR that solves that issue

### Resources

Docs and resources for OSS projects can be found in their corresponding wiki/discussions.
Since we don't really have any community managers we can't guarantee any timely response. It's just us, les dÃ©veloppeurs :)

### Hiring

We're currently hiring tech talent all over the world. Leave us a message if you're interested! ðŸ˜„
