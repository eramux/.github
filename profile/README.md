## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're Hotellistat. And we are creating the next-gen of hotel management software.

### Contribution

We accept contributions to our OSS projects. 

Please follow these steps to get started:

1. Navigate to the project
2. Create a new issue, stating what you would like to contribute and what your contributions solves
3. We'll discuss your issue and will accept or reject your offer
4. You, others or we can then create a PR that solves your issue

### Resources

Docs and resources for OSS projects can be found in their correclating wiki/discussions.
Since we don't really have any community managers, we can't guarantee any timely response, since it's just us, les dÃ©veloppeurs :)
